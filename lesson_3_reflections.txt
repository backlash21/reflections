Caching your GitHub password in Git
MAC WINDOWS LINUX ALL
If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.

If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you authenticate using SSH keys instead of a username and password. For help setting up an SSH connection, see Generating SSH Keys.

Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.
If you install GitHub for Windows, the credential helper is included. The app also provides a Git shell so you won't ever need to install and configure Git manually.

If you prefer working with the command line, you can also install a native Git shell, such as msysgit. With msysgit, running the following in the command line will store your credentials:

git config --global credential.helper wincred
